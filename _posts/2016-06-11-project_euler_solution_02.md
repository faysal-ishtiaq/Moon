### Problem:

#### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#### 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#### By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution: 

#### C: 

{% highlight c %}
{% raw %}


{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %} 

#### Python:

{% highlight c %}
{% raw %}
