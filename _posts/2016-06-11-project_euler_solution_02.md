### Problem:

#### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

#### 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

#### By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution: 

#### C: 

{% highlight c %}
{% raw %}
int main()
{
	int first_num = 0, second_num = 1, total = 0;

	while(first_num+second_num < 4000000)
	{
	    first_num += second_num;
	    second_num += first_num;
	    
	    if(first_num % 2 == 0) total += first_num;
	        
	    if(second_num % 2 == 0) total += second_num;
	}

	printf("%d", total);

	return 0;	
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %} 

#### Python:

{% highlight python %}
{% raw %}
